We use Labs\benchmark_comparison.py to compare between Lab2 and Lab3. We added the source file in benchmarks to be the setup, but the actual place of the ran benchmark_comparison.py which used to generate Benchmark Comparison Report below is not at the place described

BLab2 prioritizes speed with in-memory operations, while Lab3 prioritizes persistence and scalability with database storage. The performance trade-off (20-40% slower response time in Lab3) is acceptable given the added functionality of persistent storage,
PageRank ranking, and production-ready architecture.
